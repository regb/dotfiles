# Personal dotfiles

This contains my main personal dotfiles. These are symlinked from the expected system location, updating any of these will directly update the system config.

## NeoVim

Neovim config is in `nvim/`.

## Opencode

In `opencode/`, it should be symlinked directly for ~/.config/opencode
